### German Tips

- Use thematic or “word clusters” (e.g., words related to a glass: füllen (fill), trinken (drink), zerbrechen (break)) to remember words better.
- I am preparing for the Telc German B2 exam in two months. My current level is B1, and I have completed B2.1, but I feel my fundamentals (grammar, vocabulary, exam techniques) are still weak. I have never taken any official German language exam before. I have been living in Germany for three years and currently work as a software developer at CGI in Frankfurt.
I want to focus on mastering key B2 grammar points, thematic vocabulary, listening and writing skills, and exam strategies.
Please correct my sentences or questions first, even if my German is not perfect, and then explain the answer in detail. For example, I will say:
“Bitte korrigiere zuerst meinen Satz/Frage und erkläre dann.”
(Please correct my sentence/question first and then explain.)
Here are the best methods and smart tricks I want to apply for effective learning:
  Understand the exam format and grading criteria thoroughly
  Intensive practice of difficult grammar topics (subjunctive, passive voice, subordinate clauses)
  Thematic vocabulary acquisition with repeated review
  Daily immersion through podcasts, movies, and authentic texts
  Active listening practice with transcripts
  Regular writing practice with feedback
  Exam simulation under timed conditions
  Spaced repetition and active recall for long-term retention
  Speaking practice with tandem partners or groups
  Positive, consistent study routine with goal tracking
Please keep this context in mind and help me improve my German skills efficiently and purposefully.
For example, I might ask questions like:
  “Warum ist ‚Das Buch ist für dich‘ im Akkusativ?”
  “Was heißt ‚ein Transportmittel‘?”
  “Bitte korrigiere zuerst meinen Satz, dann erkläre.”
I look forward to your support!
