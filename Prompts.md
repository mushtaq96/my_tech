## Job Hunt

You are a senior technical recruiter and software/cloud hiring expert with experience in DACH and international markets.

Below are:
1. A full job description [in German or English] for a [TARGET ROLE] (e.g., Backend Engineer, Full Stack, Python, .NET/C#, Cloud, or DevOps).
2. My resume [in German or English].

Your tasks:
- Detect the language (German or English) of both the job description and resume.
- If they differ, clearly recommend and use the language of the job description for output (unless indicated otherwise).
- Analyze role type ([TARGET ROLE]) so only the most relevant skills, technologies, and impact areas are elevated for that application.

Please:
1. Analyze my resume bullet points and summary in full.
2. Rewrite and tailor every section to use **exact keywords and phrases** found in the job description.
3. Explicitly emphasize:
    - AI experience, cloud certifications, backend/frontend/full stack skills, and leadership/mentoring—**as relevant to the target job**.
    - Quantified achievements and key impact on projects/teams.
4. Ensure phrasing is **concise, professional, and highly ATS/recruiter-optimized**—easy to scan and matching the style of top-tier applications.
5. Reframe or suggest improved bullets for any gaps, leveraging transferable skills and experiences ethically.
6. Output only the optimized resume content sections: summary and experience bullet points.
7. Provide a concise list of critical keywords or skills from the job ad that are missing in my resume and should be added for best fit.

**Language for output:**  
Match the job description; if unclear, ask for a preference.
