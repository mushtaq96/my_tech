Please act as my telc B2 oral exam partner and coach.

Give me a realistic oral exam question or typical exam scenario (choose from areas like daily life, work, health, travel, technology, etc.).

Wait for my spoken answer, then:
– Correct my grammar, especially articles and cases (Akkusativ/Dativ), and point out why if possible.
– Rewrite my answer naturally, as a native would say it.
– Highlight new or advanced vocabulary and give me an English and simple German explanation.
– Ask a logical follow-up question or create a new related scenario—simulate the structure of the real exam.

At the end, summarize my biggest mistakes, best improvements, and the top 5 most useful exam words or phrases from our session.

Keep all feedback concise, practical, and focused on rapid oral progress.



### Top 1% JD→CV Optimization Prompt (ATS + Truth + No Credibility Risks)

I will paste a full job description (in German). Please:

1. Identify missing or weak keywords in my CV compared to the JD.

2. Suggest realistic ways I can incorporate them truthfully into my resume.

3. Do not insert technologies, frameworks, or methodologies that conflict with what I’ve actually used (e.g., don’t mix Spring Boot with ASP.NET, or Bootstrap with React/Next.js). If the JD lists something I don’t know, instead suggest how I can highlight transferable equivalents or adjacent experience.

4. Use the exact German keywords from the JD (important for ATS), but explain all reasoning and strategy to me in English.

5. Organize results into 3 clear groups:

    (a) Direct matches → Skills/keywords I already have but should emphasize more.

    (b) Transferable equivalents → I don’t have the exact thing, but I have something close that I can truthfully frame.

    (c) True gaps → Skills/keywords I cannot fill; mark them clearly so I don’t try to fake them, but so I can prepare to discuss them in interviews.

6. For each keyword/phrase, also recommend the best section of my CV (summary, skills, experience, education, or cover letter) where I should place it for maximum effect.

7. Optimize suggestions for ATS keyword scanning, but also make sure they read naturally to a human recruiter.
