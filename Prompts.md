Please act as my telc B2 oral exam partner and coach.

Give me a realistic oral exam question or typical exam scenario (choose from areas like daily life, work, health, travel, technology, etc.).

Wait for my spoken answer, then:
– Correct my grammar, especially articles and cases (Akkusativ/Dativ), and point out why if possible.
– Rewrite my answer naturally, as a native would say it.
– Highlight new or advanced vocabulary and give me an English and simple German explanation.
– Ask a logical follow-up question or create a new related scenario—simulate the structure of the real exam.

At the end, summarize my biggest mistakes, best improvements, and the top 5 most useful exam words or phrases from our session.

Keep all feedback concise, practical, and focused on rapid oral progress.





### Top 1% JD→CV Optimization Prompt (ATS + Truth + No Credibility Risks)

I will paste a full job description (in German) and my current resume. Please:

1. Keyword Gap Analysis
- Identify missing or weak keywords in my CV compared to the JD.
- Identify Direct matches / Transferable equivalents / True gaps using exact German JD keywords.
- For each keyword, suggest the best CV section (Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Cover Letter) in a single table.

2. Safe Incorporation Strategy

- Suggest realistic ways I can incorporate them truthfully into my CV.
- Do not invent or assume technologies I haven’t used.
- Flag unrealistic claims.
- If the JD lists something I don’t know, suggest how to highlight transferable equivalents or adjacent experience.
- Never combine mutually exclusive technologies in the same project bullet (e.g., Supabase vs. MongoDB, React vs. Angular, Kubernetes vs. pure Serverless). If unsure, give me Option A/Option B versions and let me choose.
- Optional, If tech is relevant but not tied to a project, recommend placement in Skills or Summary instead.

3. Conflict & Timeline Guardrails

- Respect timeline accuracy (e.g., Supabase only from 2021 onwards).
- Before final output, do a quick conflict check for contradictory tech stacks. If there’s a risk, flag it and provide alternatives.
- If a technology is relevant but not tied to a specific project, recommend placing it in Skills or Summary instead.

4. Organize results into 3 clear groups:
(a) Direct matches → Skills/keywords I already have but should emphasize more.
(b) Transferable equivalents → Not an exact match, but I have something close I can truthfully frame.
(c) True gaps → Skills/keywords I cannot fill. Mark them clearly so I don’t fake them but can prepare for interviews.

5. Placement Guidance
- For each keyword/phrase, recommend the best section of my CV where I should place it (Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Cover Letter).

6. Optimization Rules
- Optimize suggestions for ATS keyword scanning but keep them natural for German human recruiters. Use concise, punchy German phrases suitable for CVs in Germany.
- Adjust sentence structure and word order to sound natural to German recruiters without changing factual content (“mit Schwerpunkt auf”, “im Bereich”, active verbs first).
- Avoid long sentences.
- Always prioritize truth over keyword stuffing.
- You may suggest slight embellishments (e.g., framing adjacent experience more strongly), but you must:
  (a) Tell me exactly which part is being embellished.
  (b) Confirm whether it’s realistic for me to self-learn quickly so I can defend it confidently in an interview.

7. Final Deliverable:
- Updated CV bullets / summary ready for ATS & human recruiters.
- Executive summary (max 6 lines in one paragraph, German-native phrasing).

Limit placement suggestions to Summary, Skills, and Experience sections.
The following is a German job description and my modified German CV. Begin by analyzing them. Keep all German keywords, phrases, and technical terms intact, but explain and provide recommendations in English.

**Personalization algorithm for “personal touch”:**
If no direct match exists, leave <<personal touch sentence>> for manual editing.”
1. Extract from the job description and company website a concrete product, project, or company value.
2. Connect it with one real, specific experience, interest, or value of mine.
3. Generate one compelling sentence that naturally fits in the Anschreiben to make it feel like I wrote it myself.
**Note:** Limit both <<personal touch sentence>> and <<Unique differentiator / culture fit sentence>> to **1 sentence each** to prevent over-expanding.

**Example sentence:**

> „Besonders begeistert mich <<Produkt>>, da ich in meiner vorherigen Tätigkeit bei <\<Firma/Projekt>> gelernt habe, <\<konkrete Erfahrung/Ergebnis>>, was perfekt zu Ihrer Mission passt.“

---

**Tone and language:**

* Keep tone professional, motivated, natural, and consistent in first-person “Ich” perspective.

---

**Keywords:**

* Highlight 3–5 strategic skills, technologies, and qualifications exactly as they appear in the job description per paragraph **using Word-compatible bold formatting** (e.g., **C#**, **React**).
* Avoid keyword stuffing; keywords must be contextually relevant.

---

**Openings & closings:**

* Opening sentence should convey immediate enthusiasm and specificity about the role or company.
* Closing should emphasize my readiness to contribute and potential value to the team.

---

**Guardrails:**

* Do not invent company facts or products. If uncertain, leave placeholders for manual review.
* Limit buzzwords to only those present in the JD or your CV.
* Ensure CV examples are directly relevant to the job’s responsibilities.
* Verify that all company products, services, and technologies are accurate.
* If a job description lacks specifics, leave placeholders for manual review and avoid generic statements.

---

**Output format:**

* Structure

1. Opening paragraph (3–5 sentences): Hook about the company/product. Headline achievement early. Optional personal touch.
2. Middle paragraph (3–5 sentences): Focus on 3–5 bolded technologies or skills (contextual, not list). Use specific CV examples showing results/impact. Keep paragraph readable; avoid keyword stuffing.
3. Closing paragraph (3 sentences max): Emphasize contribution and value. Restate motivation and readiness.
