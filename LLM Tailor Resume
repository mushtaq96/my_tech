Prompt Template

I will paste a full job description (in German) and my current resume. Please:

Step 1: JD Keyword Extraction

Extract all technical keywords and important phrases exactly as written in the JD (German).

Output as a clean bullet list.

Step 2: Keyword Gap Analysis

For each JD keyword, check my CV and classify as:

✅ Direct Match → already present.

⚖️ Transferable Equivalent → close but not exact, frame truthfully.

❌ True Gap → missing, do not fake.

Create a table: Keyword | Match Type | Placement Recommendation (Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Cover Letter) | Safe Incorporation Strategy.

Step 3: Conflict & Timeline Guardrails

Do not backdate technologies (e.g., Supabase only after 2021).

Flag contradictory tech stacks (e.g., React vs Angular, MongoDB vs SQL only).

If unsure, give me Option A / Option B phrasing to choose.

Step 4: Incorporation Strategy

Suggest realistic ways to add missing/weak keywords without exaggeration.

Use my Tech Stack Cheat Sheet (✅ strong, ⚖️ light, ❌ none).

❌ = never suggest. ⚖️ = only “Grundkenntnisse” or “akademisch”. ✅ = emphasize.

If a keyword is relevant but not tied to a project, recommend placement in Skills or Summary instead.

Step 5: Output Format

Always include these sections in order:

JD Keyword List (German)

Gap Analysis Table (as defined above)

Conflict Check & Risk Flags

Safe Incorporation Notes (short)

Executive Summary (German, ≤6 lines, ATS-friendly)

Updated CV Summary + Skills (ready to copy)

Suggested Experience Bullets (only where needed)

Optimization Rules

Keep ATS keywords natural for German recruiters.

Use punchy German phrases (“mit Schwerpunkt auf …”, “entwickelte …”).

No long sentences.

Prioritize truth > keyword stuffing.

If suggesting embellishments, mark them clearly and confirm if they’re defensible in interviews.

Keep everything short, scannable, and table-based where possible.
